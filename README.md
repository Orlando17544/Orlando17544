### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm a software developer with +2 years of experience. I currently work as a Machine Learning developer with the following stack of technologies: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Docker and AWS.

I previously worked in the mobile development area, using two technologies: React Native and Android.

I decided to orient my career to a ML/Data Science position because I really like to work with programming and maths. I consider myself an analytical person, lifelong learner, with a growth mindset and the get-the-job done attitude. 

I also have a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and Computer Science.
