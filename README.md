### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Mobile developer with 2 years of experience in React Native and Android in two companies: Hackademy y Workana. I have developed 3 mobile apps with React Native and javascript, 2 with Android and Kotlin and fixed bugs of a React Native app.

I love applying responsive design principles and watching my mobile applications shrink into different screen resolutions and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those mobile applications; I'm moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, responsive design principles and the Model View View Model (MVVM) method of organizing code. So far I have Java, Kotlin, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, React Native, Redux and Git/GitHub under my belt. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding mobile in my head.
